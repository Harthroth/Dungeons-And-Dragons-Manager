# Dungeons-And-Dragons-Manager
A small project creating a small user interface to manage campaign notes and dice rolls.

The program will...
 - Roll various types of dice with custom animations
 - Hold information on monster stats
 - Hold character sheet information
 - Automatically tell if a dice roll hits against a specific creature or player
 - Allow map information to be stored, placing markers and holding text in them
 - Auto generate NPCs
